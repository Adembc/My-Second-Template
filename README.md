## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) -  Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards
- [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) -  the web's most popular icon set and toolkit.

### What I learned

In this  project I become more familiar with reponsivity And improve the use of CSS grid and CSS flexbox 

#### Some css code I'm proud of
```css
.container {
    padding: 0 15px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
/* Small */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
      width: 750px;
    }
  }
  /* Medium */
  @media (min-width: 992px) {
    .container {
      width: 970px;
    }
  }
  /* Large */
  @media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .container {
      width: 1170px;
    }
  }
```

### Continued development

I'll go ahead to the next step and start learning Javascript
